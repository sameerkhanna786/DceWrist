Compartment Models Parameter Calculation of Regions of Interest in Wrist MRIs

This is the code I used for my publication "Comparison of Common Kinetic Models for Dynamic Contrast Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Rheumatoid Arthritis in the Wrist"

This code allows analysis of regions of interest drawn by rheumatologists on MRIs of wrists. 
Using various mathematical models and abstractions, we measure how blood flows and interacts with tissues.
We can use this to estimate a disease activity score (DAS), a score that measures the intensity of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in the joints of the wrist.
